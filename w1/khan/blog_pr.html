        <p>My classmates and me saw something very funny in the classroom, but it's only funny when you see it, with writing you won't get that enjoy that we got, anyway I will that post, maybe it will be interesting for you. One of my friend and just classmate fights with each other when teacher went out for a long time. It was very funny and they fight so ridiculous that I decided to take a picture and take a video. </p>

        <p>It was my birthday and I decided to not celebrate it because I don't such kind of people who loves to celebrate it. I did not invent anyone. I just wanted to spend time with my family. I was wainting for good gift from my parents. At night at 12 am. Until that I was sleeping. They woke me up, congrutulate and give just picture with horses. I was disappointed, it was not that I was expected. </p>
